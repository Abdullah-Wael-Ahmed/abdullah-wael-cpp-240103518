Question 3

initial


Before change:

top = -1
stack = []

After change:

top = -1
stack = []

push(5)

Before Change:

top = 0
stack = [5]

After change: 

top = 0
stack = [5]

push(6)

Before change:

top = 1
stack = [5, 6]

After change:

top = 1
stack = [5, 6]

pop()

Before change:

top = 0
stack = [5]
return = 6

After change:

top = 0
stack = [5]
return = 6

pop()

Before Change:

top = -1
stack = []
return = 5

After change:

top = 0
stack = [5]
return = -999

// Here when doing pop is empty returned true because the top is 0 but really one element is stuck 

pop()

Before change:

top = -1
stack = []
return = -999

After change:

top = 0
stack = [5]
return = -999


The stack starts normally in both cases when pushing the problem occurs when we start popping because the stack's push is pre increment so it's logical to start from -1, but what's happening now is that the stack is locked out of one space and its current size is smaller by one
